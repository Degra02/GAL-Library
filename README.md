<h1>What's missing</h1>
<h2>Eigenvalues & eigenvectors</h2>
Unfortunately as for right now, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not a part of the program, we still have to find a way to correctly solve the whole polinomial
calculus problem.<br>
If you have any idea on how to solve this, do not hesitate to contact us.<br>
<h2>Problems with parameter</h2>
Solving matrices with a 'k' parameter is still something we have not found a way to solve but we will be working on it.<br>
Just like with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, do not hesitate to contact us.
