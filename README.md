# Get Started 
  In order to get started with the program, just download the .zip file and extract all in a folder.  
  Then just click on the GAL-Solver link and the program will start.  

# User Guide
  The Guide with every command in detail can be downloaded from here >> [User Guide](User-Guide/User_Guide.pdf)  

# What's missing
## Eigenvalues & eigenvectors
Unfortunately as for right now, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are not a part of the program, we still have to find a way to correctly solve the whole polinomial
calculus problem.  
If you have any idea on how to solve this, do not hesitate to contact us.  

## Problems with parameter
Solving matrices with a 'k' parameter is still something we have not found a way to solve but we will be working on it.  
Just like with eigenvalues and eigenvectors, do not hesitate to contact us.
