<br>

# Get Started 
## Windows
  In order to get started with the program, just download the .zip file and extract all in a folder or clone the repository using **git clone**.    
  Then just click on the GAL-Solver link and the program will start.

  <br>

## Linux
  If you're using Linux, you probably know the drill. Select the folder where you want to clone the repo and use the following command:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Degra02/GAL-Library.git"
```

Then go inside the Gal-Library directory and run

```bash
output/main
```
<br>

# Compiling the Program  
  In order to compile all the files, just run the following command in the root directory of the program:  
```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra src/*.cpp -Iinclude -o output/main  
```

# What's missing

## Problems with parameter
Solving matrices with a 'k' parameter is still something we have not found a way to solve but we will be working on it.  
Do not hesitate to contact us.
